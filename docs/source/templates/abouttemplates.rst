About the Templates
*******************

We provide here a set of template scripts and notebooks for standard data analysis tasks with Cait. This e.g. includes:

- the conversion of RDT files to HDF5 files,
- the event viewing inside a notebook and with an interactive t-SNE plot,
- the processing of HDF5 files for standard events and trigger thresholds,
- the triggering of CSMPL files,
- the processing of HDF5 files for energy spectra and light yield plots,
- the simulation of cut efficiencies.

All scripts come with instructions on top of the script. All notebooks come with a detailed walk-through as
markdown text.

Once you pulled or installed Cait, you can find all these scripts and notebooks in the directory cait/docs/source/templates.
