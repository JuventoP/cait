The quickest way to get Cait is right now to run

.. code:: console

    $ pip install -U wheel setuptools twine
    $ pip install git+https://git.cryocluster.org/fwagner/cait.git@dev_0.1.0a4

in your console and then start going through the tutorial notebooks, that demonstrate almost all functionality of Cait.

In the future, we will add a notebook "An Analysis in an Hour", in which we produce a publication-ready energy spectrum
and bandfit on real, measured data in a few steps, that are reproducible for a beginner in less than an hour. However,
for this we have to accumulate publicly accessible data first.
