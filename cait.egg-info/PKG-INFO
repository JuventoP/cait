Description: # cait
        
        Cait (abbreviation for "Cryogenic Artificial Intelligence Tools") is a Python 3 software package for the machine learning based analysis
        of raw data from cryogenic dark matter experiments. In the current version, it is tailored to the needs of the CRESST
        experiment, but also suitable for the COSINUS and NUCLEUS experiment.
