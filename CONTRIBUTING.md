The Cait-library is in a very early stage of development and anybody is welcome
to contribute. To coordinate efforts, please get in touch with 
felix.wagner@oeaw.ac.at if you want your features to be included in the coming
release.

Please read the page "Code Structure" in the Wiki first and follow the overall
philosophy for user interaction. However, just start with cloning the git repo
to your machine and create a new branch for your feature. We are looking forward
to hearing from you!
